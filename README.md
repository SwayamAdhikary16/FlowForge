YouTube Comments Performance Tracker/Youtube Comments ETL Pipeline


This project is designed to build an **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline** for fetching and analyzing YouTube comments. By automating the process of gathering comments, transforming them into structured data, and loading them for further analysis, you can gain insights from user feedback on your YouTube videos. This setup is ideal for tracking engagement, sentiment analysis, and overall performance.

## Features

- **ETL Pipeline for YouTube Comments**: Automatically extract comments from specific YouTube videos, transform the data, and load it for further processing or analysis.
- **Sentiment Analysis (Optional)**: Analyze comments to gauge user sentiment on videos.
- **Customizable Video Tracking**: Target specific videos by their unique ID.
- **Scalable Architecture**: The pipeline can be expanded to accommodate other platforms in the future.

## Future Advancements

- **Twitter Integration**: Plan to extend the pipeline to fetch tweets based on hashtags, mentions, or keywords.
- **Multi-Social Media Support**: Integration with additional platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, and Reddit to gather a more comprehensive understanding of social media engagement.
- **Advanced Data Visualization**: Build upon the data collected by the pipeline to visualize trends and insights.

### Detailed Steps

1. **User Input**: The user provides the YouTube video ID.
2. **Extract**: 
   - The pipeline uses the YouTube Data API to fetch comments for the specified video.
3. **Transform**: 
   - The comments are cleaned and structured using Pandas for easier manipulation and analysis.
4. **Sentiment Analysis**: 
   - Sentiment analysis is applied to the cleaned comments to gauge viewer sentiment regarding the content.
5. **Load**: 
   - The cleaned and analyzed data is loaded into a database or data storage for future access and reporting.
6. **Scheduling**: 
   - Apache Airflow is utilized to manage and schedule all tasks, ensuring the pipeline runs at specified intervals, providing up-to-date comments and analyses.
